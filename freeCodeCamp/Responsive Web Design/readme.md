# Responsive Web Design :computer:

In this **Responsive Web Design Certification**, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: <span style="color:yellow;">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</span> for content, <span style="color:yellow;">and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</span> for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the `basics of HTML and CSS`. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like `CSS variables` by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

Finally, you'll learn **how to make webpages that respond to different screen** sizes by building a photo gallery with `Flexbox`, and a magazine article layout with `CSS Grid`.
